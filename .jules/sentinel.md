## 2026-04-24 - Cryptographically Insecure executionId Generation
**Vulnerability:** The ProcessExecutor used `Math.random()` to generate `executionId`s, which is predictable and insecure for cross-execution tracking.
**Learning:** Randomness in sandboxed environments must be cryptographically secure to prevent identifier collisions and execution manipulation.
**Prevention:** Always use Node.js `crypto.randomBytes()` instead of `Math.random()` for any system-level identifiers.
